# This file configures the OAuth PAM module for use with SSH.

# Section 1: (REQUIRED) Determine which OAuth token providers to support
###############################################################################

# Choose with OAuth token provider to support. Valid values are globus_auth,
# scitokens or both. Then configure the choosen auth_method(s) in its
# cooresponding secion below.
#
# * SciTokens support requires configuration at build time.
auth_method globus_auth
#auth_method scitokens
#auth_method globus_auth, scitokens

# Section 2: (OPTIONAL) Configure Globus Auth support
#
# * This section must be completed if you are using the globus_auth auth_method
###############################################################################

# In order to configure your SSH service for use with Globus Auth, you must
# first visit https://developers.globus.org/ to register this SSH service as
# a client to Globus Auth. Afterwards, record the client id and secret with
# client_id and client_secret, respectively.

# Set this key to the client id received when you registered this SSH service
# with Globus Auth.
client_id  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Set this key to the client secret received when you registered this SSH
# service with Globus Auth.
client_secret  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#
# ACCOUNT MAPPING OPTIONS
#
# When a user connects via oauth-ssh, the service will initially know the
# connected user as a Globus Auth identity. The following options allow you to
# specify how the SSH service should 'map' those identities to local accounts.
#
# NOTE: You may choose idp_suffix, map_file, or both. But you must choose at
# least one. A connecting user will be able to take advantage of all configured
# mapping options.

# (OPTIONAL) idp_suffix is used for account mapping. Set this to the domain
# of the chosen IdP, as known by Globus Auth. When a user connects, the module
# will search for a linked identity for the user issued by this IdP. If a match
# is found, the username associated with the linked identity becomes an option
# for a local account mapping. You can only specify one domain using idp_suffix.
#idp_suffix globus.org

# (OPTIONAL) Specify a text file to be used to map linked identities to local
# accounts. See the example map file for details on its format.
map_file /etc/oauth_ssh/globus-acct-map

# Use this option multiple times to include additional map files.
#map_file path-to-mapfile2

#
# HIGH ASSURANCE (SESSION) OPTIONS
#
# The following three options (permitted_idps, authentication_timeout, mfa) allow
# the system administrator to impose stricter authentication requirements.
#
# See https://docs.globus.org/api/auth/sessions/ for more information.

# (OPTIONAL) Require that users have authenticated to one or more of the
# following identity providers within their current session. The value
# is a comma-separated list of identity providers. If left blank, the user
# may authenticate to any Globus-supported identity provider.
#
# Note that idp_suffix and map_file are used to configure which local accounts
# are usable by a user's linked identities. permitted_idps configures which linked
# identity with which the user must have recently authenticated. In most cases,
# the value of permitted_idps should match idp_suffix.
#
#permitted_idps globus.org, xsede.org

# (OPTIONAL) Require that the user has authenticated within the current session
# within the recent timeframe. The value of this option is minutes since
# authentication permitted for successful user login. When used in conjunction
# with permitted_idps, the user is required to have authenticated within
# this timeout with one of the permitted_idps. If permitted_idps is not
# specified, the user is required to have authenticated to any Globus-supported
# identity provider within the given timeframe.
#
# Comment out or give a value of 0 to disable this feature.
#authentication_timeout 60

# (OPTIONAL) Require that the user has authenticated within the current session
# using multi-factor authentication. When used with permitted_idps, the user
# must use mfa with one of the permitted_idps to successfully login.
#
# Valid values are 'true' and 'false' The default is 'false'.
#mfa true

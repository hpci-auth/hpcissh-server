# The format of this file is:
#  - blank lines are ignored
#  - comments begin with '#' and are ignored
#  - one key/value pair per line, separated by space
#  - keys do not need to be unique, values will be merged for matching keys
#  - the user will be able to choose which account to use based on any
#    key matching any of his/her linked identities. Order within this file
#    is not important.
#  - leading spaces are ignored
#  - each key must be an Auth identity id or username
#  - value must specify one or more local accounts delimited by space or commas

# Examples:
#
# Map user with linked identity 'johndoe@globus.org to local account 'johndoe':
#
# johndoe@globus.org johndoe

# Add two additional account options for johndoe. This is automatically added
# with the previous example:
#
# johndoe@uchicago.org jd, jdoe

# Map user with linked ID 8aa6baa8-127f-4e34-b7e7-fa232bad1d8f to 'janedoe':
#
# 8aa6baa8-127f-4e34-b7e7-fa232bad1d8f janedoe

# Assuming 'Jeff Doe' has linked accounts jeff@xsede.org, doe@globus.org,
# Jeff will be able to choose to login into either of these accounts:
#
# jeff@xsede.org jeffdoe
# doe@globus.org jeff_doe
